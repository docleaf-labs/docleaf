# Docleaf Changelog

## Version 0.7.0 - 2023-06-22

### Fixed 

- Fixed handling of args string values for member variables. Docleaf uses the args string if it is detected as part
  of a function pointer member variable otherwise it does not attempt to pass it on to the Sphinx C or C++ domain as
  it might be long and complex and fail the parsing in the domain code.
- Fixed namespacing indicator in text rendering of member variable types in C when passing to Sphinx domains.

## Version 0.6.0 - 2023-06-20

### Fixed 

- Construction of various docutils nodes, including `literal`, which derive from docutils `TextElement` base class.

### Fixed

- Fixed Doxygen-based cross-references between restructured text source files.
